## Requirements

### Node version
Please refer to [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/getyoti/yoti-node-sdk) to see all compatible Node versions.

### Windows users

If you're planning on using the Node SDK on Windows, you'll need to install a few dependencies first:

* [OpenSSL](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) (normal version, not light) in the same bitness as your Node.js installation.

  * OpenSSL must be installed in its specific directory (`C:\OpenSSL-Win32` or `C:\OpenSSL-Win64`)
  * See [this wiki from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/nodejs-guidelines/blob/master/windows-environment.md) for common configuration issues.

* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) (`npm install -g node-gyp`)

  * Either install Microsoft's [windows-build-tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools) using `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`
  * Or manually install [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/download/) and [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) (or modify an existing installation) and select Common Tools for Visual C++ during setup.

## Installing the SDK

To import the Yoti SDK inside your project, you can use your favourite dependency management system.
If you are using NPM, you can use the following command to set the Yoti SDK as a dependency:

```shell
npm install -S -E yoti
```

Your package.json file will then be updated to include:

```json
"dependencies": {
     "yoti" : "x.x.x"
 }
 ```

## Setup

For each service you will need:

* Your Client SDK ID, generated by [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com) when you create (and then publish) your app. 
* Your .pem file. This is your own unique private key which your browser generates from the [Yoti Hub](https://hub.yoti.com) when you create an application.

## Products

The Yoti SDK can be used for the following products, follow the links for more information about each:
1) [Yoti app integration](/docs/PROFILE.md) - Connect with already-verified customers.
1) [Yoti Doc Scan](/docs/DOCSCAN.md) - Identity verification embedded in your website or app.
